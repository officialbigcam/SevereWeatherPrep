## Severe Weather Prepardness Equipment and Procedures Checklist
<<<<<<< HEAD
# This project is a work in progress developed with C# using .NET6 framework.
This app uses the following features as required by the project requirements document:

-A loop that allows the user to enter commands and eventually exit the program
-A to-do list feature where the user can add, remove, and display their equipment
-A mathematical calculation of how many days it has been since the Moore, OK EF5 Tornado

I created three different classes and their respective methods to ensure the program runs properly. 

The goal of this project is to help the end user prepare for severe weather encounters like Tornado warnings/emergencies.
The user will be able to create and display a list of equipment to pack in their bugout bag (emergency prepardness kit).
After this, they can view a list of procedures to help them minimize the danger they face during severe weather events. 

This project has been made possible by the generous assistance of Code Louisville 
mentors, classmates, and meteorologists with the goal of optimizing survivability 
in the event the user encounters dangerous weather situations.

# This practice project is a work in progress developed with C# using .NET6 framework. 
As of 02/08/2023, the goals of this project include but are not limited to:
-a simple list that allows the user to take acountability of equipment they
want to add to their emergency prepardness (bugout) bag
-a list of procedures advising the user how to efficiently prepare and survive
severe weather encounters 

Required features that this project has as of 02/23/2023
1)master loop that lets user exit program after they add equipment and view procedures
2)a method that creates a new list with several values
3)equipment class that inherits from Procedures 

This practice project has been made possible by the generous assistance of Code Louisville 
mentors, classmates, and certified meteorologists with the goal of optimizing survivability 
in the event the user encounters dangerous weather situations. This project is to be used
as a draft/example of demonstrating project requirements for SD1
