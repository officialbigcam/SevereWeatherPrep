## Severe Weather Prepardness Equipment and Procedures Checklist
<<<<<<< HEAD
# This project is a work in progress developed with C# using .NET6 framework.
This app uses the following features as required by the project requirements document:

-A master loop that allows the user to enter commands, start over, or exit the program
-A list feature of the Procedure objects that retrieve a value and displays to the user
-A mathematical calculation of how many years it has been since the Moore, OK EF5 Tornado.
This calculation returns a value to the user in the number of years it has been since then.
-Three objects that inherit two properties from their parent class. See "Procedure"

I created four classes and their respective methods to ensure the program runs properly. 

The goal of this project is to help the end user better prepare for severe weather encounters like Tornado warnings/emergencies.
The user will be able to create and display a list of equipment to pack in their bugout bag (emergency prepardness kit).
After this, they can view a list of procedures to help them minimize the danger they face during severe weather events. 

This project has been made possible by the generous assistance of Code Louisville 
mentors, classmates, and meteorologists with the goal of optimizing survivability 
in the event the user encounters dangerous weather situations.
