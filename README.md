## Severe Weather Prepardness Equipment and Procedures Checklist
<<<<<<< HEAD
# This project was developed in C# using .NET6 framework.
This app uses the following features as required by the project requirements document:

-A master loop that allows the user to enter commands, start over, or exit the program
-A list feature of the Procedure objects that retrieves a value and displays to the user
-A mathematical calculation of how many years it has been since the Moore, OK EF5 Tornado.
This calculation returns a value to the user in the number of years it has been since then.
-Three objects that inherit two properties from their parent class. See "Procedure"

The goal of this project is to help the end user better prepare for severe weather encounters like Tornado warnings/emergencies.
The user will be able to create and display a list of equipment to pack in their bugout bag (emergency prepardness kit).
The user will then be given the option to clear their bugout equipment list and start over, or exit the application.  
They will also be able to view survivability procedures when they are finished accounting for the gear they've packed and are ready to exit the app.

This project has been made possible by the generous assistance of Code Louisville 
mentors, classmates, and meteorologists with the goal of optimizing survivability 
in the event the user encounters dangerous weather situations.
